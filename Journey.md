## ***Key Words***

- **Boilerplate code**  - The code that is always written at the starting of the program .

>FOR EXAMPLE : 

```
# include <iostream>
using namespace std ;
int main() {

    return 0;
}
```

- ***Convergen*** - converting one data type to another . 
> They are of two types Type convergen and Type Casting
>- Type convergen is implicit ( happens on its own ) .
>- Type casting is explicit ( forefully done by user ) .
```
//type convergen 
float a = 100.11;
int b = a;

// type casting 
float a = 100.11;
a = (int) a;
```
